# 🚀 **Pico Train**

Pico Train is a lightweight framework for training language models—from tiny-scale (~1M parameters) to mid-scale (~1B parameters)—with built-in rich checkpointing that captures activations, gradients, and model states, enabling detailed learning dynamics research.

Our **suite of pre-trained models** is already publicly available on our [Hugging Face organization](https://huggingface.co/pico-lm), and a dedicated companion library for advanced analysis—[**pico-analyze**](https://github.com/pico-lm/pico-analyze)—is fully released for deeper checkpoint studies.

## **Key Features**

1. **Pico Decoder: LLAMA-style Transformer Architecture**  
   - RMSNorm, RoPE, multi-head self-attention with KV-cache, and SwiGLU activations  
   - Currently supports the **pico-decoder** model, with future expansions planned (pico-diffusion, pico-statespace, etc.)

2. **Comprehensive Checkpoints**  
   - Saves model states, optimizer states, and training metadata  
   - Enriched with **activation and gradient** snapshots for interpretability  

3. **Focused Scale Range**  
   - Optimized to train models from **1M to 1B parameters**, where learning dynamics research is most viable  

4. **Clean, Pre-tokenized Data**
   - Uses a pre-tokenized, pre-shuffled version of [Dolma](https://allenai.org/dolma) that we make available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pico-lm/pretokenized-dolma)  
   - Facilitates training models using identical data for **consistency** and **comparability**

5. **Experiment Tracking & Sharing**  
   - Optional integration with [Pico Labs](https://picolabs.space) for web-based experiment tracking  
   - Automatic git commit tracking to link code state with training runs  
   - Easy collaboration and sharing of training results

6. **Research Ready**  
   - Minimal, well-documented code suitable for **forking and tailoring**  
   - Logs essential metrics (e.g. perplexity) throughout training  
   - Works seamlessly with [pico-analyze](https://github.com/pico-lm/pico-analyze) for advanced post-training interpretation

## **Training Philosophy**

All models in the Pico suite (both pre-trained and user-trained):

- Employ **identical architectures** and **optimizer settings**  
- **Share** the same data order and tokens  
- Automatically log **rich checkpoint data** (including activations, gradients)  
- Facilitate **direct cross-scale comparisons**

This uniformity means you can isolate model size as the primary variable, giving you clearer insights into **how model capacity affects learning**.

## **Resources**

- **Pre-trained Models** (1M–1B parameters), publicly hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/pico-lm)
- **Pre-tokenized Datasets** for straightforward streaming-based training  
- **Extensive Checkpoints** logging activation and gradient snapshots  
- **Evaluation Metrics** (perplexity and more) tracked at each checkpoint

---

## **Core Components**

- **Pico-Decoder Model**  
  - LLAMA-style auto-regressive transformer  
  - RMSNorm  
  - RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings)  
  - Multi-head attention with KV-cache  
  - SwiGLU activation  
  
  *Future plans include additional architectures like pico-diffusion and pico-statespace.*

- **Training & Checkpointing**  
  - Automatic storage of model and optimizer states  
  - Periodic hooks for saving **learning dynamics** (activations, gradients)  
  - Optional logging to Weights & Biases and Pico Labs
  - Git integration for tracking code changes with experiments

- **Config-Driven Setup**  
  - Specify architecture, optimizer, dataset, and logging settings in YAML  
  - Straightforward to extend or modify

## **Quick Start**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pico-lm/pico-train
   cd pico-train
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**

   Create a `.env` file at the root with your Hugging Face and Weights & Biases tokens:
   ```bash
   export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_key
   
   # Optional: For Pico Report integration
   export PICO_API_KEY=your_pico_api_key
   export PICO_LAB_HASH=your_lab_hash
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   source setup.sh
   ```
   This script checks your environment, installs necessary tools, and sets up a Poetry virtual environment.

4. **Train Your Model Suite**

   - Edit (or create) a config file (e.g., `configs/demo.yaml`) to specify your architecture and training preferences.
   - Then run:
     ```bash
     poetry run train --config_path configs/demo.yaml
     ```
   - This launches training, automatically checkpointing states and saving learning dynamics data.

5. **Explore Checkpoints**
   - By default, checkpoints are stored under `runs/YOUR_RUN_NAME/checkpoints/`.
   - Each checkpoint contains:
     - **Model state** (PyTorch + Hugging Face formats)
     - **Optimizer state**
     - **Gradients and activations** for interpretability
     - **Evaluation logs** (e.g. perplexity) and metrics

## **Pico Report Integration**

Pico Train integrates seamlessly with [Pico Labs](https://picolabs.space), a platform for tracking and sharing experiments. When enabled, your training metrics are automatically logged to your private dashboard, making it easy to monitor runs and share results with collaborators.

### **Setup**

1. **Install pico-report** (optional dependency):
   ```bash
   poetry install --extras pico-report
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export PICO_API_KEY=your_pico_api_key
   export PICO_LAB_HASH=your_lab_hash
   ```

3. **Enable in your config**:
   ```yaml
   monitoring:
     save_to_picolabs: true
     pico_report:
       lab_hash: "your_lab_hash"  # Optional if set via env var
       auto_commit: true  # Optional, automatically create git commits (default: true)
   ```

### **Benefits**

- **Unified Dashboard**: View training metrics alongside analysis results from pico-analyze
- **Automatic Tracking**: Loss, perplexity, and custom metrics logged in real-time
- **Easy Sharing**: Share your training runs with collaborators via a simple link
- **Version Control**: Track different training runs over time
- **Git Integration**: Automatically commit your code state with each training run to track exactly what configuration was used
